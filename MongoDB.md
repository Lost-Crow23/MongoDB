<h1>What is MongoDB? </h1>

MongoDB is a open source document-oriented NoSQL database program and stores data such like JSON. Provides high performance, scalability and flexibility to 
applications. It also allows developers to store data without the pre-defined data structure which is very dynamic. The model allows developers to store and 
retrieve data in a intuitive way. They use sharding to manage data.

<h2>What are NoSQL databases? How do they differ from SQL?</h2>

- Non-relational databases to store and manage data.
- "Not only SQL" means that these databases can handle data that are unstructered or not and provides a more scalable solution.
- Classed as document-oriented, key-value, graph, object-oriented database
- Unique data model, storage architecture, query language and used for specific use cases and data types.

<h2>Why is MongoDB popular? What is itâ€™s history?</h2>

- Schema-less, does not require predefined schemas or data structure for agile development.
- High perfomance , providing fast/write operations, due to the optimized servers for high availability of applications.
- Flexbility, handles different types of data whether they are structered or not.
- Easy integration, consists of drivers and connectors for many programming langauges and platforms.
- Cloud based, an atlas of database service, which MongoDB is properly managed within it's deployment on AWS, Google cloud and Azure.

What is seeding in MongoDB? Why do Mongo databases need to be seeded? 

- Refers to the process of initializing a database with predefined data used for testing or development.
- Seed data can be created using MongoDB's shell or client libraries or importing data from a JSON file.
- Inserting data onto other collections within the database using the insert commands.
- Data types in seeding are, strings, numbers, booleans, arrays.
- Automated using MongoDB Mongoose seeder or MongoDB seeder which creates a seed data from javascript objects.
- Testing, Development, Migration, Restoration, Demonstration, Performance testing and Integration testing all require for the databases to be seeded.

What port does MongoDB use?

- Port 27017
