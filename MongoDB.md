<h1>What is MongoDB? </h1>

MongoDB is a open source document-oriented NoSQL database program and stores data such like JSON. Provides high performance, scalability and flexibility to applications. It also allows developers to store data without the pre-defined data structure which is very dynamic. The model allows developers to store and retrieve data in a intuitive way. They use sharding to manage data, which breaks up it up in horizontal pieces.



<h2>What are NoSQL databases? How do they differ from SQL?</h2>

- Non-relational databases to store and manage data.
- "Not only SQL" means that these databases can handle data that are unstructered or not and provides a more scalable solution.
- Classed as document-oriented, key-value, graph, object-oriented database
- Unique data model, storage architecture, query language and used for specific use cases and data types.

<h2>Why is MongoDB popular? What is itâ€™s history?</h2>

- Schema-less, does not require predefined schemas or data structure for agile development.
- High perfomance , providing fast/write operations, due to the optimized servers for high availability of applications.
- Flexbility, handles different types of data whether they are structered or not.
- Easy integration, consists of drivers and connectors for many programming langauges and platforms.
- Cloud based, an atlas of database service, which MongoDB is properly managed within it's deployment on AWS, Google cloud and Azure.

<h2>What is seeding in MongoDB? Why do Mongo databases need to be seeded?</h2>

- Refers to the process of initializing a database with predefined data used for testing or development.
- Seed data can be created using MongoDB's shell or client libraries or importing data from a JSON file.
- Inserting data onto other collections within the database using the insert commands.
- Data types in seeding are, strings, numbers, booleans, arrays.
- Automated using MongoDB Mongoose seeder or MongoDB seeder which creates a seed data from javascript objects.
- Testing, Development, Migration, Restoration, Demonstration, Performance testing and Integration testing all require for the databases to be seeded.

 <h2>What port does MongoDB use?</h2>

- Port 27017 is used by default for client connections but other ports can also be used such as, and depending on the requirements of MongoDB deployment.
  - port 27018, replica sets of communication.
  - port 27019, shared communication.
  - port 28017, web interface
